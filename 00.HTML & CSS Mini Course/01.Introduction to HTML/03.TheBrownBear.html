    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <p>
      The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia
      and North America.[1][3] It is one of the largest living terrestrial
      members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest
      relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in
      size and slightly bigger on average.
